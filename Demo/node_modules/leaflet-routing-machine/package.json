The plugin supports multiple backends:\n\n* [OSRM](http://project-osrm.org/) - builtin and used by default (version 5)\n* [Mapbox Directions API](https://www.mapbox.com/developers/api/directions/) - builtin with the class `L.Routing.Mapbox`\n* [GraphHopper](https://graphhopper.com/) - through plugin [lrm-graphopper](https://github.com/perliedman/lrm-graphhopper)\n* [Mapzen Valhalla](https://mapzen.com/projects/valhalla/) - through plugin [lrm-valhalla](https://github.com/valhalla/lrm-valhalla)\n* [TomTom Online Routing API](http://developer.tomtom.com/io-docs) - through plugin [lrm-tomtom](https://github.com/mrohnstock/lrm-tomtom) by [Mathias Rohnstock](https://github.com/mrohnstock)\n* Legacy support for OSRM version 4 through plugin [lrm-osrm4](https://github.com/perliedman/lrm-osrm4)\n* Esri - through plugin [lrm-esri](https://github.com/jgravois/lrm-esri)\n\n## Features\n\n* Standard Leaflet control, with Leaflet look and feel\n* Routing from start to destination, with possibility of via points\n* Add, edit and remove waypoints through both address input and using the map\n* Multiple language support\n* Highly customizable for advanced use\n* Customizable look (theming / skins)\n* Open Source released under ISC License (more or less equivalent with the MIT license)\n\n__Go to the [Leaflet Routing Machine site](http://www.liedman.net/leaflet-routing-machine/) for more information, demos, tutorials and more.__\n\n## Support and New Features\n\nLeaflet Routing Machine is in many ways already a feature complete routing UI. Most likely, your requirements are already covered and require very little adaptation.\n\nIf you have more complex requirements, need new features or just need some support, I am open to doing paid custom work and support around Leaflet Routing Machine for your organization. Contact me at [per@liedman.net](mailto:per@liedman.net) and we'll sort this out!\n\nFor questions and discussions, you might want to look at [the Leaflet Routing Machine gitter](https://gitter.im/leaflet-routing-machine/Lobby).\n\n## Building\n\n```sh\nnpm install\n```\n\nThis requires [Node and npm](http://nodejs.org/), as well as `grunt`.\n",
